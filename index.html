               <p>Penguins are suited <strong>extremely</strong> well to life in ocean water. <br>They are incredibly fast swimmers, making it a difficult task for anyone wanting a penguin lunch.<br>Their plumage is countershaded for camouflage meaning: they have dark plumage on their backs and wings, and white on their fronts.<br><br>A predator looking from below has trouble distinguishing the white penguin belly from the reflective surface of the water and sky.

            <h2><u>10 Fun Penguin Facts:</u></h2>
             <p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Penguins are diving experts</strong></li>
                Emperor penguins can dive down to 530m while looking for food
              <br><br>
                <li><strong>The fastest penguin would get a ticket for speeding in a school zone</strong></li>
                Gentoo penguins can swim up to a speed of 36km/h
              <br><br>
                <li><strong>Penguins have been around for a very long time</strong></li>
                The oldest penguin fossils ever found are 62 million years old
              <br><br>
                 <li><strong>Penguins may huddle together for several reasons</strong></li>
                  Doing so helps protect from predators and helps retain warmth in frigid temperatures
              <br><br>
                <li><strong>Penguins evolved to "fly" underwater</strong></li>
                Birds typically have hollow bones to assist with flying, but not penguins. Penguins have solid bones.<br>This helps them sink in the water, allowing them to dive through the water at incredible speeds
              <br><br>
                <li><strong>Male penguins gift females rocks</strong></li>
                No, we are not talking about diamonds.<br>Males do this to woo a potential mate, and the female will use these rocks to build a nest
              <br><br>
                <li><strong>Giant penguins once roamed the Earth</strong></li>
                  Fossils found in Antarctica from 37 million years ago suggests ancestors of modern penguins may have been 2m (6.5 feet) tall and weighed over 100 kg (220 pounds)
              <br><br>
                 <li><strong>Penguins are faithful to their mate</strong></li>
                  Many species of penguins partner up for life and some will return to the exact same spot to greet their mate every breeding season
              <br><br>   
                 <li><strong>Penguins are actually excellent walkers</strong></li>
                  Emperor penguins are known to waddle and slide on their bellies up to 100km to reach their destination
              <br><br>
                  <li><strong>Penguins poop...a lot</strong></li>
                  Their metabolism is very fast, which means penguins poop every 20 minutes. That's a whole lotta poop
             </p>
