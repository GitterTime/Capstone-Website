      <h2>PENGUIN DEFENSE</h2>
            <!--add paragraph here-->
        <p class="second-paragraph">Penguins are suited <em><strong>extremely</strong></em> well to life in ocean water. <br>They are incredibly fast swimmers, making it a difficult task for anyone wanting a penguin for lunch.<br><br>Their plumage is countershaded for camouflage, which means: <br>they have dark plumage on their backs and wings, and white on their fronts.<br><br><br>A predator looking from below has trouble distinguishing the white penguin belly<br>from the reflective surface of the water.

        <h2>10 FUN FACTS ABOUT PENGUINS</h2>
      <section class="fourth-section">            
      <br>
        <p class="fourth-paragraph">
          <ol>
            <li><strong><em><u>Penguins are diving experts</u></em></strong></li><br>
                Emperor penguins can dive down to 530m while looking for food
              <br><br>
            <li><strong><em><u>The fastest penguin would get a ticket for speeding in a school zone</u></em></strong></li><br>
                Gentoo penguins can swim up to a speed of 36km/h
              <br><br>
            <li><strong><em><u>Penguins have been around for a very long time</u></em></strong></li><br>
                The oldest penguin fossils ever found are 62 million years old
              <br><br>
            <li><strong><em><u>Penguins may huddle together for several reasons</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Doing so helps protect from predators and helps retain warmth in frigid temperatures
              <br><br>
            <li><strong><em><u>Penguins evolved to "fly" underwater</u></em></strong></li><br>
                Birds typically have hollow bones to assist with flying, but not penguins. Penguins have solid bones.<br>This helps them sink in the water, allowing them to dive through the water at incredible speeds
              <br><br>
            <li><strong><em><u>Male penguins gift females rocks</u></em></strong></li><br>
                No, we are not talking about diamonds.<br>Males do this to woo a potential mate, and the female will use these rocks to build a nest
              <br><br>
            <li><strong><em><u>Giant penguins once roamed the Earth</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Fossils found in Antarctica from 37 million years ago suggests ancestors of modern penguins may have been 2m (6.5 feet) tall and weighed over 100 kg (220 pounds)
              <br><br>
            <li><strong><em><u>Penguins are faithful to their mate</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Many species of penguins partner up for life and some will return to the exact same spot to greet their mate every breeding season
              <br><br>   
            <li><strong><em><u>Penguins are actually excellent walkers</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Emperor penguins are known to waddle and slide on their bellies up to 100km to reach their destination, but with the weakness of the ice from climate change, their colonies have to move further inland making them walk even further distances some seasons
              <br><br>
            <li><strong><em><u>Penguins poop...a lot</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Their metabolism is very fast, which means penguins poop every 20 minutes. That's a whole lotta poop
              <br><br>
        </p>
          </ol>
        <p class="fifth-paragraph"><strong><em><u>Bonus Fact:</u></em></strong> Unlike many tv shows and movies, penguins and polar bears are never seen together because they live at opposite ends of the Earth. <br>Polar Bears live up north in the Arctic, while Penguins are down in the southern hemisphere
