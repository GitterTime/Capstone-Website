            <h2>10 FUN FACTS ABOUT PENGUINS</h2>
            <br>
             <p class="fourth-paragraph">
              <ol>
                <li><strong><em><u>Penguins are diving experts</u></em></strong></li><br>
                Emperor penguins can dive down to 530m while looking for food
              <br><br>
                <li><strong><em><u>The fastest penguin would get a ticket for speeding in a school zone</u></em></strong></li><br>
                Gentoo penguins can swim up to a speed of 36km/h
              <br><br>
                <li><strong><em><u>Penguins have been around for a very long time</u></em></strong></li><br>
                The oldest penguin fossils ever found are 62 million years old
              <br><br>
                 <li><strong><em><u>Penguins may huddle together for several reasons</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Doing so helps protect from predators and helps retain warmth in frigid temperatures
              <br><br>
                <li><strong><em><u>Penguins evolved to "fly" underwater</u></em></strong></li><br>
                Birds typically have hollow bones to assist with flying, but not penguins. Penguins have solid bones.<br>This helps them sink in the water, allowing them to dive through the water at incredible speeds
              <br><br>
                <li><strong><em><u>Male penguins gift females rocks</u></em></strong></li><br>
                No, we are not talking about diamonds.<br>Males do this to woo a potential mate, and the female will use these rocks to build a nest
              <br><br>
                <li><strong><em><u>Giant penguins once roamed the Earth</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Fossils found in Antarctica from 37 million years ago suggests ancestors of modern penguins may have been 2m (6.5 feet) tall and weighed over 100 kg (220 pounds)
              <br><br>
                 <li><strong><em><u>Penguins are faithful to their mate</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Many species of penguins partner up for life and some will return to the exact same spot to greet their mate every breeding season
              <br><br>   
                 <li><strong><em><u>Penguins are actually excellent walkers</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Emperor penguins are known to waddle and slide on their bellies up to 100km to reach their destination
              <br><br>
                  <li><strong><em><u>Penguins poop...a lot</u></em></strong></li><br>
                  Their metabolism is very fast, which means penguins poop every 20 minutes. That's a whole lotta poop
              <br><br>
             </p>
              </ol>
              <p class="fifth-paragraph"><strong><em><u>Bonus Fact:</u></em></strong> Unlike many tv shows and movies, penguins and polar bears are never seen together because they live at opposite ends of the Earth. <br>Polar Bears live up north in the Arctic, while Penguins are down in the southern hemisphere
